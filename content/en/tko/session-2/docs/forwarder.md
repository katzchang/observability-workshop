**Objective:** Learn how to monitor Linux system logs with the Universal Forwarder sending logs to Splunk Enterprise

**Duration**: 10 Minutes

## Scenario

You've been tasked with monitoring the OS logs of the host running your Kubernetes cluster. We are going to utilize a script that will autodeploy the Splunk Universal Forwarder. You will then configure the Universal Forwarder to send logs to the Splunk Enterprise instance assigned to you.

### 1. Ensure You're in the Correct Directory

- we will need to be in /home/ubuntu/session-2

``` bash
cd /home/ubuntu/session-2
```

### 2. Review the Universal Forwarder Install Script

- Let's take a look at the script that will install the Universal Forwarder and Linux TA automatically for you. 
  - This script is primarily used for remote instances.
  - Note we are not using a deployment server in this lab, however it is recommended in production we do that.
  - What user are we installing Splunk as?

``` bash
#!/bin/sh  
# This EXAMPLE script shows how to deploy the Splunk universal forwarder
# to many remote hosts via ssh and common Unix commands.
# For "real" use, this script needs ERROR DETECTION AND LOGGING!!
# --Variables that you must set -----
# Set username using by splunkd to run.
  SPLUNK_RUN_USER="ubuntu"

# Populate this file with a list of hosts that this script should install to,
# with one host per line. This must be specified in the form that should
# be used for the ssh login, ie. username@host
#
# Example file contents:
# splunkuser@10.20.13.4
# splunkker@10.20.13.5
  HOSTS_FILE="myhost.txt"

# This should be a WGET command that was *carefully* copied from splunk.com!!
# Sign into splunk.com and go to the download page, then look for the wget
# link near the top of the page (once you have selected your platform)
# copy and paste your wget command between the ""
  WGET_CMD="wget -O splunkforwarder-9.0.3-dd0128b1f8cd-Linux-x86_64.tgz 'https://download.splunk.com/products/universalforwarder/releases/9.0.3/linux/splunkforwarder-9.0.3-dd0128b1f8cd-Linux-x86_64.tgz'"
# Set the install file name to the name of the file that wget downloads
# (the second argument to wget)
  INSTALL_FILE="splunkforwarder-9.0.3-dd0128b1f8cd-Linux-x86_64.tgz"

# After installation, the forwarder will become a deployment client of this
# host.  Specify the host and management (not web) port of the deployment server
# that will be managing these forwarder instances.
# Example 1.2.3.4:8089
#  DEPLOY_SERVER="x.x.x.x:8089"



# After installation, the forwarder can have additional TA's added to the 
# /app directory please provide the local where TA's will be. 
  TA_INSTALL_DIRECTORY="/home/ubuntu/session-2"

# Set the seed app folder name for deploymentclien.conf
#  DEPLOY_APP_FOLDER_NAME="seed_all_deploymentclient"
# Set the new Splunk admin password
  PASSWORD="buttercup"

REMOTE_SCRIPT_DEPLOY="
  cd /opt
  sudo $WGET_CMD
  sudo tar xvzf $INSTALL_FILE
  sudo rm $INSTALL_FILE
  #sudo useradd $SPLUNK_RUN_USER
  sudo find $TA_INSTALL_DIRECTORY -name '*.tgz' -exec tar xzvf {} --directory /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/apps \;
  sudo chown -R $SPLUNK_RUN_USER:$SPLUNK_RUN_USER /opt/splunkforwarder
  echo \"[user_info] 
  USERNAME = admin
  PASSWORD = $PASSWORD\" > /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/system/local/user-seed.conf   
  #sudo cp $TA_INSTALL_DIRECTORY/*.tgz /opt/splunkforwader/etc/apps/
  #sudo find /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/apps/ -name '*.tgz' -exec tar xzvf {} \;
  #sudo -u splunk /opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk start --accept-license --answer-yes --auto-ports --no-prompt
  /opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk start --accept-license --answer-yes --auto-ports --no-prompt
  #sudo /opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk enable boot-start -user $SPLUNK_RUN_USER
  /opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk enable boot-start -user $SPLUNK_RUN_USER
  #sudo cp $TA_INSTALL_DIRECTORY/*.tgz /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/apps/

  exit

DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" >/dev/null && pwd )"


#===============================================================================================
  echo "In 5 seconds, will run the following script on each remote host:"
  echo
  echo "===================="
  echo "$REMOTE_SCRIPT_DEPLOY"
  echo "===================="
  echo 
  sleep 5
  echo "Reading host logins from $HOSTS_FILE"
  echo
  echo "Starting."
  for DST in `cat "$DIR/$HOSTS_FILE"`; do
    if [ -z "$DST" ]; then
      continue;
    fi
    echo "---------------------------"
    echo "Installing to $DST"
    echo "Initial UF deployment"
    sudo ssh -t "$DST" "$REMOTE_SCRIPT_DEPLOY"
  done  
  echo "---------------------------"
  echo "Done"
  echo "Please use the following app folder name to override deploymentclient.conf options: $DEPLOY_APP_FOLDER_NAME"
  ```
  
### 3. Run the install script

We will run the install script now. You will see some Warnings at the end. This is totally normal. 

``` bash
./install.sh
```

### 4. Verify installation of the Universal Forwarader

- We need to verify that the Splunk Universal Forwarder is installed and running.
  - You should see a couple PID's return and a "Splunk is currently running." message. 

``` bash
/opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk status
```

#### 5. Configure the Universal Forwarder to Send Data to Splunk Enterprise.

- We will be able to send the data to our Splunk Enterprise environment easily by entering one line into the cli.
  -  [Universal Forwarder Config Guide](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Forwarder/9.0.3/Forwarder/Configuretheuniversalforwarder)

``` bash
/opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk add forward-server <your_splunk_enterprise_ip>:9997
```



#### 6. Verify the Data in Your Splunk Enterprise Environment

- We are now going to take a look at the Splunk Enterprise environment to verify logs are coming in.
  - Logs will be coming into ```index=main```

- Open your web browser and navigate to: ```http://<your_splunk_enterprise_ip:8000```
  - You will use the credentials ```admin:<your_ssh_password>```

- In the search bar, type in the following:
- ```index=main host=<your_host_name>```

- You should see data from your host. Take note of the interesting fields and the different data sources flowing in.
