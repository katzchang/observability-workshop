## Code to Kubernetes - Python

**Objective:** Understand activities to instrument a python application and run it on Kubernetes.

- Verify the code
- Containerize the app
- Deploy the container in Kubernetes

**Note:** these steps do not involve Splunk

**Duration:** 15 Minutes

## 1. Verify the code - Review service

Inspect review.py (workshop/flask_apps_start/review)

``` python
from flask import Flask, jsonify
import random
import subprocess

review = Flask(__name__)
num_reviews = 8635403
num_reviews = 100000
reviews_file = '/var/appdata/yelp_academic_dataset_review.json'

@review.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return jsonify(message='Hello, you want to hit /get_review. We have ' + str(num_reviews) + ' reviews!')

@review.route('/get_review')
def get_review():
    random_review_int = str(random.randint(1,num_reviews))
    line_num = random_review_int + 'q;d'
    command = ["sed", line_num, reviews_file] # sed "7997242q;d" <file>
    random_review = subprocess.run(command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)
    return random_review.stdout

if __name__ == "__main__":
    review.run(host ='0.0.0.0', port = 5000, debug = True)
```

Inspect requirements.txt

``` text
Flask==2.0.2
```

Create a virtual environment and Install the necessary python packages

``` bash
cd workshop/flask_apps_start/review

python3 -m venv rtapp-workshop
source rtapp-workshop/bin/activate

pip freeze #note output
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip freeze #note output
```

Start the REVIEW service. **Note:** You can stop the app with control+C

``` bash
python3 review.py

 * Serving Flask app 'review' (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
         ...snip...
 * Running on http://10.160.145.246:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
127.0.0.1 - - [17/May/2022 22:46:38] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
127.0.0.1 - - [17/May/2022 22:47:02] "GET /get_review HTTP/1.1" 200 -
127.0.0.1 - - [17/May/2022 22:47:58] "GET /get_review HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

Verify that the service is working

- Use curl in your terminal
- Or hit the URL `http://{Your_EC2_IP_address}:5000` and `http://{Your_EC2_IP_address}:5000/get_review` with a browser

``` bash
curl localhost:5000
{
  "message": "Hello, you want to hit /get_review. We have 100000 reviews!"
}

curl localhost:5000/get_review
{"review_id":"NjbiESXotcEdsyTc4EM3fg","user_id":"PR9LAM19rCM_HQiEm5OP5w","business_id":"UAtX7xmIfdd1W2Pebf6NWg","stars":3.0,"useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"-If you're into cheap beer (pitcher of bud-light for $7) decent wings and a good time, this is the place for you.

- What does this application do?
- Do you see the yelp dataset being used?
- Why did the output of pip freeze differ each time you ran it?
- Which port is the REVIEW app listening on? Can other python apps use this same port?

## 2. Create a REVIEW container

To create a container image, you need to create a Dockerfile, run docker build to build the image referencing the Docker file and push it up to a remote repository so it can be pulled by other sources.

- [Create a Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/02_our_app/)
- Creating a Dockerfile typically requires you to consider the following:
  - Identify an appropriate container image
    - ubuntu vs. python vs. alpine/slim
    - ubuntu - overkill, large image size, wasted resources when running in K8
    - this is a python app, so pick an image that is optimized for it
    - [avoid alpine for python](https://lih-verma.medium.com/alpine-makes-python-docker-builds-way-too-50-slower-and-images-double-2-larger-61d1d43cbc79)
  - Order matters
    - you're building layers.
    - re-use the layers as much as possible
    - have items that change often towards the end
  - [Other Best practices for writing Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/)

Dockerfile for review

``` dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY ./review.py /app
EXPOSE 5000
CMD [ "python", "review.py" ]
```

Create a container image (locally)
Run ‘docker build’ to build a local container image referencing the Dockerfile

``` bash
(venv)% docker build -f Dockerfile -t localhost:8000/review:0.01 .
[+] Building 35.5s (11/11) FINISHED
 => [internal] load build definition from Dockerfile                              0.0s
         ...snip...
 => [3/5] COPY requirements.txt /app                                              0.0s
 => [4/5] RUN pip install -r requirements.txt                                     4.6s
 => [5/5] COPY ./review.py /app                                                   0.0s

 => => exporting layers                                                           0.2s
 => => writing image sha256:61da27081372723363d0425e0ceb34bbad6e483e698c6fe439c5  0.0s
 => => naming to docker.io/localhost:8000/review:0.1                                   0.0
```

Push the container image into a container repository
Run ‘docker push’ to place a copy of the REVIEW container to a remote location

``` bash
docker push localhost:8000/review:0.01
The push refers to repository [docker.io/localhost:8000/review]
02c36dfb4867: Pushed
         ...snip...
fd95118eade9: Pushed
0.1: digest: sha256:3651f740abe5635af95d07acd6bcf814e4d025fcc1d9e4af9dee023a9b286f38 size: 2202
```

Verify that the image is in Docker Hub. The same info can be found in Docker Desktop

``` bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/v2/_catalog
{"repositories":["review"]}
```

## 3. Run REVIEW in Kubernetes

Create K8 deployment yaml file for the REVIEW app

Reference: [Creating a Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#creating-a-deployment)

review.deployment.yaml

``` yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: review
  labels:
    app: review
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: review
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: review
    spec:
      imagePullSecrets:
      - name: regcred
      containers:
      - image: localhost:8000/review:0.01
        name: review
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/appdata
          name: appdata
      volumes:
      - name: appdata
        hostPath:
          path: /var/appdata
```

Notes regarding review.deployment.yaml:

- labels - K8 uses labels and selectors to tag and identify resources
  - In the next step, we'll create a service and associate it to this deployment using the label
- replicas = 1
  - K8 allows you to scale your deployments horizontally
  - We'll leverage this later to add load and increase our ingestion rate
- regcred provides this deployment with the ability to access your dockerhub credentials which is necessary to pull the container image.
- The volume definition and volumemount make the yelp dataset visible to the container

Create a K8 service yaml file for the review app. 

Reference: [Creating a service:](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#defining-a-service)

review.service.yaml

``` yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: review
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: review
  ports:
    - port: 5000
      targetPort: 5000
      nodePort: 30000
```

Notes about review.service.yaml:

- the selector associates this service to pods with the label app with the value being review
- the review service exposes the review pods as a network service
  - other pods can now ping 'review' and they will hit a review pod.
  - a pod would get a review if it ran `curl http://review:5000`
- NodePort service
  - the service is accessible to the K8 host by the nodePort, 30000
  - Another machine that has this can get a review if it ran `curl http://<k8 host ip>:30000`

Apply the review deployment and service

``` bash
kubectl apply -f review.service.yaml -f review.deployment.yaml
```

Verify that the deployment and services are running:

I have tasted all of the items we ordered previously (with the exception of the special) and have been blown away with how good they were.  My guy had the special which was definitely good, so no complaints there.  The onion rings and the fried pickles were greasier than expected.  Though I've thought they were delicious in the past, I probably wouldn't order either again.  The gyro burger was good, but I could have used a little more sauce.  It almost tasted like all of the ingredients didn't entirely fit together.  Something was definitely off. It was a friday night and they weren't insanely busy, so I'm not sure I would attribute it to the staff not being on their A game...\n\nDon't get me wrong.  Flip is still good.  The wait staff is still amazingly good looking.  They still make delicious milk shakes.  It's just not as amazing as it once was, which really is a little sad.","date":"2010-10-11 18:18:35"}
