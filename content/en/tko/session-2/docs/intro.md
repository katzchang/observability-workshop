## Introduction

During this technical workshop you will learn how to:

- efficiently deploy complex environments
- capture metrics from these environments to Splunk Observability
- auto-instrument a python application
- enabling logging to Splunk Enterprise via Universal Forwarder

In order to simplify the workshop modules, a pre-configured AWS EC2 instance is provided.

By the end of this technical workshop you will have an approach to demonstrating metrics collection for complex environments and services and be able to describe, at a high-level, what is required to instrument an application for distributed tracing.
